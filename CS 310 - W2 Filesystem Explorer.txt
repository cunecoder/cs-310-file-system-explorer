Question #1: How do you accept command-line arguments.
Answer: To accept command-line arguments, you simply write the name of the bash script and whatever command-line
        arguments you want, with a space inbetween them. Ex: ./exscript -v -n
        Like any other arguments, you simply type it after the bash script.

Question #2: What other programs did you use to complete this assignment? (Such as cat, sed, etc., not AI).
